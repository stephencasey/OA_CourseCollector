# OpenAdvisor

The long-term goal of this project is an app that generates a list of inexpensive transfer courses for a given college degree. This would upend the typical paradigm of a college student spending 30 minutes with an advisor to choose how they will spend $50,000+ on their degree. Instead, college students could build a University degree plan that integrates courses from nearby or online community colleges, potentially saving them thousands of dollars.

Currently, the project generates a database of 2500+ schools and 1,000,000+ course descriptions. The other half of the equation is the [serializer project](https://github.com/stephencasey/OpenAdvisor---Serializer-proof-of-concept) which illustrates how degree requirements could be integrated. The plan is to pare down the serializer project to get core functionality, while ensuring the project can be easily maintained and scaled up. 

Work in progress...
